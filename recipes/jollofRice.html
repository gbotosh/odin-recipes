    <h4>Steps</h4> 
        <ol>
            <li><p> Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. 
                    Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 
                    1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. 
                     Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. 
                    Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; 
                    cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.</p></li>
            <li><p> Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. 
                    Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. 
                    Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.</p></li>
            <li><p> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p></li>
            <li><p> Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, 
                    about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest 
                    part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p></li>
            <li><p> Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and 
                    cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. 
                    Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil,
                     5 to 7 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p> Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and 
                    pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. 
                    Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. 
                    Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy,
                    about 5 minutes.</p></li>  
            <li><p> Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. 
                    Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, 
                    about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. 
                    Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken.</p></li>
